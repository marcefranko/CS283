## Assignment 2 Questions

#### Directions
Please answer the following questions and submit in your repo for the second assignment.  Please keep the answers as short and concise as possible.

1. In this assignment I asked you provide an implementation for the `get_student(...)` function because I think it improves the overall design of the database application.   After you implemented your solution do you agree that externalizing `get_student(...)` into it's own function is a good design strategy?  Briefly describe why or why not.

    > **Answer**: In my opinion, it is a great strategy because the function managed things for us like lseeking to where the student was, or checking if the reading was succesfull or unsuccesfull, which I think avoids code duplication in other parts of the program and improves readability overall.

2. Another interesting aspect of the `get_student(...)` function is how its function prototype requires the caller to provide the storage for the `student_t` structure:

    ```c
    int get_student(int fd, int id, student_t *s);
    ```

    Notice that the last parameter is a pointer to storage **provided by the caller** to be used by this function to populate information about the desired student that is queried from the database file. This is a common convention (called pass-by-reference) in the `C` programming language. 

    In other programming languages an approach like the one shown below would be more idiomatic for creating a function like `get_student()` (specifically the storage is provided by the `get_student(...)` function itself):

    ```c
    //Lookup student from the database
    // IF FOUND: return pointer to student data
    // IF NOT FOUND: return NULL
    student_t *get_student(int fd, int id){
        student_t student;
        bool student_found = false;
        
        //code that looks for the student and if
        //found populates the student structure
        //The found_student variable will be set
        //to true if the student is in the database
        //or false otherwise.

        if (student_found)
            return &student;
        else
            return NULL;
    }
    ```
    Can you think of any reason why the above implementation would be a **very bad idea** using the C programming language?  Specifically, address why the above code introduces a subtle bug that could be hard to identify at runtime? 

    > **ANSWER:** I think the reason why this is a terrible idea is because when 'get_student' returns, the variable 'student' is automatically deallocated, so the memory it occupied is no longer valid. So the caller funtion that recieves the deallocated pointer to the student struct will attempt to use it, and like that, resulting in unexpected behaviour. 

3. Another way the `get_student(...)` function could be implemented is as follows:

    ```c
    //Lookup student from the database
    // IF FOUND: return pointer to student data
    // IF NOT FOUND or memory allocation error: return NULL
    student_t *get_student(int fd, int id){
        student_t *pstudent;
        bool student_found = false;

        pstudent = malloc(sizeof(student_t));
        if (pstudent == NULL)
            return NULL;
        
        //code that looks for the student and if
        //found populates the student structure
        //The found_student variable will be set
        //to true if the student is in the database
        //or false otherwise.

        if (student_found){
            return pstudent;
        }
        else {
            free(pstudent);
            return NULL;
        }
    }
    ```
    In this implementation the storage for the student record is allocated on the heap using `malloc()` and passed back to the caller when the function returns. What do you think about this alternative implementation of `get_student(...)`?  Address in your answer why it work work, but also think about any potential problems it could cause.  
    
    > **ANSWER:** I think I ran into this problem during Assignment 1: The reason why this one works is because of malloc(). By allocating memory on the heap, we ensure that the student structure remains valid, even after the function returns. However, this may cause potential problems like having to free that memory when it is no longer needed. Additionally, if the student is not in the database, we would have malloced unesesarilly, which is inefficient.


4. Lets take a look at how storage is managed for our simple database. Recall that all student records are stored on disk using the layout of the `student_t` structure (which has a size of 64 bytes).  Lets start with a fresh database by deleting the `student.db` file using the command `rm ./student.db`.  Now that we have an empty database lets add a few students and see what is happening under the covers.  Consider the following sequence of commands:

    ```bash
    > ./sdbsc -a 1 john doe 345
    > ls -l ./student.db
        -rw-r----- 1 bsm23 bsm23 128 Jan 17 10:01 ./student.db
    > du -h ./student.db
        4.0K    ./student.db
    > ./sdbsc -a 3 jane doe 390
    > ls -l ./student.db
        -rw-r----- 1 bsm23 bsm23 256 Jan 17 10:02 ./student.db
    > du -h ./student.db
        4.0K    ./student.db
    > ./sdbsc -a 63 jim doe 285 
    > du -h ./student.db
        4.0K    ./student.db
    > ./sdbsc -a 64 janet doe 310
    > du -h ./student.db
        8.0K    ./student.db
    > ls -l ./student.db
        -rw-r----- 1 bsm23 bsm23 4160 Jan 17 10:03 ./student.db
    ```

    For this question I am asking you to perform some online research to investigate why there is a difference between the size of the file reported by the `ls` command and the actual storage used on the disk reported by the `du` command.  Understanding why this happens by design is important since all good systems programmers need to understand things like how linux creates sparse files, and how linux physically stores data on disk using fixed block sizes.  Some good google searches to get you started: _"lseek syscall holes and sparse files"_, and _"linux file system blocks"_.  After you do some research please answer the following:

    - Please explain why the file size reported by the `ls` command was 128 bytes after adding student with ID=1, 256 after adding student with ID=3, and 4160 after adding the student with ID=64? 

        > **ANSWER:** Well, as far as I know, this is because each data structure is 64 bytes. As mentioned in the instructions the first 64 bytes will not be used (0 - 63), so student 1 will start at byte 64 and end at byte 127, which are 128 bytes in total (that is why we see 128 in the terminal). When we introduce student 3, we will start writing it at byte 192, and finish on byte 255, being in total 256 bytes in the file. Now, student 64 will start at byte 4096, and finish at byte 4159, So in total there are 4160 bytes as shown in the terminal.

    -   Why did the total storage used on the disk remain unchanged when we added the student with ID=1, ID=3, and ID=63, but increased from 4K to 8K when we added the student with ID=64? 

        > **ANSWER:** It turns out that the bigger the memory the slower it is (traditionally), doing things like reading byte per byte or 64 bytes per 64 bytes is super inefficient becuase, again, the disk is slow. So to avoid making so many syscalls, the disk actually works with bigger chuncks of memory (1k per 1k) to maximize efficiency. However, Linux likes working with even bigger chunks of code (4k per 4k), and that is basically the reason why we don't see 8k until student 63: When we create student 1 and 3, the 4k block of memory is still big enough to save our database, but when we inlcude student 63, our database needs another 4k block.

    - Now lets add one more student with a large student ID number  and see what happens:

        ```bash
        > ./sdbsc -a 99999 big dude 205 
        > ls -l ./student.db
        -rw-r----- 1 bsm23 bsm23 6400000 Jan 17 10:28 ./student.db
        > du -h ./student.db
        12K     ./student.db
        ```
        We see from above adding a student with a very large student ID (ID=99999) increased the file size to 6400000 as shown by `ls` but the raw storage only increased to 12K as reported by `du`.  Can provide some insight into why this happened?

        > **ANSWER:**  Well, according to my reaserch this is due to sparcefiles. Sparcefiles let programs create files that look large but donâ€™t actually take up space for empty gaps between written data. Our database does not fill the gaps with actual data; only the necessary blocks for metadata and the new student record are physically stored.
